# VirtualCursor-HandTrackingTech-

This project focuses on creating a system to control the computer cursor using hand tracking. By leveraging hand gestures, users can interact with their computer, providing a hands-free alternative to traditional input devices like a mouse and keyboard.


The primary goal is to improve accessibility and offer touchless control, especially useful in environments like presentations, gaming, or for people with disabilities.
